**Part 1**

In this part of the exercise, you will identify error codes and error messages that will be part of the response body of your API if there's a problem
in fulfilling a request. the response body will look as below

```
{
    "statusCode" : 201,
    "errorCode" : 1234,
    "errorMessage" : "Invalid resource name cars"
